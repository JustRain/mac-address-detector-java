# mac-address-detector-java
Use pcap4j to detect a mac address of remote host
# reason
I searched the whole website, and I found no solution provided to detect a mac address of remote host under same subnetwork. <br>
<br>
So I created this project.
# Implementation
I used pcap4j to send and filtering packets. 
and for a IPv4 address, I used arp protocol related function to extract the mac address.
and for a IPv6 address, I used ndp (neighbor discovery) protocol related function to extract the mac address.


# dependency
1. pcap4j. 
2. libpcap.
